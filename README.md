# Some of the challenges:
### immer installed but is not used, because immer for one dimensional array's immuted operation.Root data fetching is allBlogs feature. So this feature's  state very nested. So this not for immer . Already i know that, but i learned more about this.

### react-reveal a bug lossed half-day, the bug was of react-reveal. react-reveal published was 5 years old. so maybe react-reveal isn't for this time.
